##How to load the project
###Components needed
####Botstrap(v3.3.7 minified)
Bootstrap is the magical front-end framework that makes the site look pretty, format correctly on all browsers, and respond to different browser sizes so the site works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop. All the source files are in the assets directory. 
####jQuery(v3.1.0 compressed)
